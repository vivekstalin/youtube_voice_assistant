## Getting Started
Hey Guys! I am giving this project as an idea to develop a simple and super cool voice assistant bot that can play something for you on youtube when you speak to it

### Prerequisites

Doesn't need much except Python and few Python Packages
* Python
  ```
  python version 3.5+
  ```
* Python Packages
  ```
  1. SpeechRecognition
  2. pyttsx3
  3. playsound
  4. pywhatkit
  ```
### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vivekstalin/youtube_voice_assistant.git
   ```
## Usage
I have kept the code open and it is visible for you in .py format

**Clone it, Fork it, Modularize it and Extended it to make your own bot**
 
The sample version I have put here works in the below way:
```
1. Run the main file ~/src/voice.py
2. It would start taking to you. My Bot name is Jarvis
3. Say after beep <bot name> <play> <content in youtube>
   Ex1: Jarvis play faded song
   Ex2: Jarvis play Falcon heavy test flight
4. There you go, you will see the youtube video getting played automatically on youtube in the browser
PS:
There would be debris file created by pywhatkit package when you run it for first time, dont mind just ignore.
```
